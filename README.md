### Key DAX Measures

```DAX
-- Churn Rate Calculation
Churn Rate = 
VAR ChurnedCustomers = CALCULATE(COUNTROWS(Customers), Customers[Churn] = "Yes")
VAR TotalCustomers = COUNTROWS(Customers)
RETURN DIVIDE(ChurnedCustomers, TotalCustomers, 0)

-- Revenue by Time Period
Total Day Revenue = 
CALCULATE(
    SUM(Calls[Charge]),
    Calls[Period] = "Day"
)

-- Customer Lifetime Value
CLV = 
CALCULATE(
    SUM(Calls[Charge]),
    ALLEXCEPT(Customers, Customers[CustomerID])
)

-- Churn Risk Score
Churn Risk Score = 
VAR ServiceCalls = [Total Service Calls]
VAR DayCharge = [Avg Day Charge]
VAR HasIntlPlan = SELECTEDVALUE(Customers[InternationalPlan])
RETURN
    SWITCH(
        TRUE(),
        ServiceCalls >= 4, "High",
        HasIntlPlan = "Yes", "High",
        DayCharge > 50, "Medium",
        "Low"
    )
```

### Performance Optimization Techniques

1. **Aggregation Tables**: Pre-calculated summaries for common queries
2. **Calculated Columns vs. Measures**: Strategic use based on cardinality
3. **DirectQuery vs. Import**: Import mode for better performance
4. **Query Folding**: Pushed transformations to source systems
5. **Incremental Refresh**: Only load changed data
